# mcms-news-export

This project produced two XML files.

1. `articles.xml` with all of the (2001-10 - 2013-11) news articles
2. `users.xml` with all of the authors of those articles

Both files were imported using the [WP All Import](http://www.wpallimport.com) WordPress plugin.

The in-WordPress news site has launched and this will probably never be used again.
